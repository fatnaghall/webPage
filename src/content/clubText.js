Our mission excites, inspires, and enables students for exploration of science and technology outside the classroom.

QUARKS is a place where students learn, make, share, ask questions, fail boldly, and succeed proudly.

We aim to:
• Advance scientific thinking and digital literacy through hands-on projects.
• Encourage leadership, cooperation, and initiative.
• Connect university learning with professional practice.
• Ease knowledge exchange between Algerian universities and other countries.

We’re moving one step closer each time with every idea, experiment, and discussion.

export const TEXT_ABOUT = `
Science Club QUARKS is an academic and social project, conceived and run by a group of Computer Science students, convinced that science must not be just studied, but shared, discussed, and lived.

Through collaboration and mentorship, we combine theoretical and practical knowledge to prepare students for a successful career in research or industry, and connect with other clubs across universities in Algeria.

Advices to Build a Website:
Building a website is like constructing a digital home — every element matters.
Here’s a set of friendly tips:

Do’s:
• Map your site and user flow before coding.
• Clarify the value: what problem do you solve?
• Keep color & typography consistent and readable.
• Make it mobile-friendly on all devices.
• Test links, performance, and accessibility.
• Update regularly — a good site grows with its community.

Don’ts:
• Don’t overload pages with animations or dense text.
• Avoid low-contrast colors with hard-to-read fonts.
• Don’t ignore user feedback.
• Don’t copy; be original. Make it yours.
